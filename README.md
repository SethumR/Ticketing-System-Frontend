## üõ†Ô∏è Introduction

The Real-Time Ticket Simulation System is an interactive web application designed for real-time ticket management. The interface includes three buttons:

- Configuration: Set or load ticket simulation settings.
- Start: Begin the ticket simulation process.
- Stop: Halt the simulation at any time.
- A responsive design for seamless usage across devices.

The simulation updates in real time, displaying the current ticket array size. Users can manage configurations, control the simulation process, and observe real-time changes directly in the UI.
